This is the ansible Playbooks which I practice using AWS EC2 where I created 3 servers 1st is Controller and 2 Manage Nodes which is interconnected to each other using public key /etc/hosts where I installed Ansible in the Manage Nodes using sudo apt-get install -y ansible
Hence I performed Ansible remote configuration of servers in
3 different ways
1 Adhoc commands
2 Playbooks
3 Roles
